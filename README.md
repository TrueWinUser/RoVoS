This is my program for creating a report on the value of securities. 
RoVos - Report on the Value of Securities

it can create a report on how much the price of a security has changed relative to the purchase price that you specify in the "Add Share" function. 
The tickers of the stocks you are tracking are stored in a file tickers.txt . 
It initially contains several tickers to demonstrate the capabilities of the program. You can delete them via the "Delete Share" function.
